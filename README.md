# DCS_Config
This repository is a store for all configuration I use in DCS. Storing it on github because DCS updates (or windows reinstalls) will remove this config.

## General
To fix the jittery slider on the x52, install both [freePIE](https://andersmalmgren.github.io/FreePIE/) and [vJoy](http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net/site/]).

Run the script `slider_fix` script in freePIE before any DCS session. Also, don't forget to calibrate the vjoy slider in controller settings so it has the full range of motion.

## KA-50
Trimmer position is set to center. Don't forget to disable FFB.
